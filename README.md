# pdf-split

This utility is used to sort PDFs scanned at home.

I developed this so that I can scan all of my home paperwork and then allow python to use "pdftk" to split the documents.

Future developments:
- Interleave and reverse odd/even pages
- Reduce the size of larger PDFs (https://askubuntu.com/questions/207447/how-to-reduce-the-size-of-a-pdf-file)
- Rotate individual pages
- Allow pages to be split in format of 1-5, 7, 8-12 (commas and dashes)
- OCR of PDFs
- GUI
